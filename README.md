RNNs (Neural networks with feedback) are very useful in NLP and language modelling

Recurrent neural networks can also be used as generative models.

This means that in addition to being used for predictive models (making predictions) they can learn the sequences of a problem and then generate entirely new plausible sequences for the problem domain.

Generative models like this are useful not only to study how well a model has learned a problem, but to learn more about the problem domain itself.
